this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . ||| 3
um , no. . ||| 2
jonathan parker 's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . ||| 3
campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful . ||| 3
a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . ||| 1
béart and berling are both superb , while huppert ... is magnificent . ||| 4
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . ||| 1
the film is strictly routine . ||| 1
a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . ||| 3
the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore 's the scarlet letter . ||| 1

blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . ||| 1
you ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . ||| 1
a slick , engrossing melodrama . ||| 4
a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man 's quest to find an old flame . ||| 1
eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso 's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . ||| 2
will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . ||| 1
one of -lrb- jaglom 's -rrb- better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . ||| 2
lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience . ||| 0
the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . ||| 3
the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once ... a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller . ||| 4

he may have meant the internet short saving ryan 's privates . ||| 2
though jackson does n't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees . ||| 3

this is amusing for about three minutes . ||| 2
though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . ||| 3
superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . ||| 4
a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity . ||| 3
it 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . ||| 3
the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms. ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting . ||| 3

an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . ||| 0

the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . ||| 3
it 's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . ||| 1
jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . ||| 1
jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . ||| 2
... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . ||| 1
over and over again . ||| 1

sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . ||| 1
it 's mostly a pleasure to watch . ||| 3
a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . ||| 2
its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing . ||| 3
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . ||| 1
i did n't find much fascination in the swinging . ||| 1
