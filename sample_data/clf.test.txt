a stirring , funny and finally transporting re-imagining of beauty and the beast and 1930s horror films ||| 4
apparently reassembled from the cutting-room floor of any given daytime soap . ||| 1
they presume their audience wo n't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . ||| 1
the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . ||| 2
this is a visually stunning rumination on love , memory , history and the war between art and commerce . ||| 3
um , no. . ||| 2
jonathan parker 's bartleby should have been the be-all-end-all of the modern-office anomie films . ||| 3
campanella gets the tone just right -- funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful . ||| 3
a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down . ||| 1
béart and berling are both superb , while huppert ... is magnificent . ||| 4
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium . ||| 1
the film is strictly routine . ||| 1
a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world . ||| 3
the most repugnant adaptation of a classic text since roland joffé and demi moore 's the scarlet letter . ||| 1
for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -lrb- sci-fi -rrb- rehash . ||| 1
this is a stunning film , a one-of-a-kind tour de force . ||| 4
may be more genial than ingenious , but it gets the job done . ||| 3

as quiet , patient and tenacious as mr. lopez himself , who approaches his difficult , endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline . ||| 4
final verdict : you 've seen it all before . ||| 0
blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . ||| 1
you ... get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone . ||| 1
a slick , engrossing melodrama . ||| 4
a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man 's quest to find an old flame . ||| 1
eccentric enough to stave off doldrums , caruso 's self-conscious debut is also eminently forgettable . ||| 2
will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic . ||| 1
one of -lrb- jaglom 's -rrb- better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love . ||| 2
lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child 's interest and an adult 's patience . ||| 0
the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be . ||| 3
the film is moody , oozing , chilling and heart-warming all at once ... a twisting , unpredictable , cat-and-mouse thriller . ||| 4
too bad . ||| 1
a strong first act and absolutely , inescapably gorgeous , skyscraper-trapeze motion of the amazing spider-man . ||| 4
gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance . ||| 1
you end up simply admiring this bit or that , this performance or that . ||| 2
a well-intentioned effort that 's still too burdened by the actor 's offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility . ||| 1
analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film 's successes , with a few new swings thrown in . ||| 2
there 's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings . ||| 2
a fun ride . ||| 3
what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film 's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . ||| 2
an edgy thriller that delivers a surprising punch . ||| 3
` what 's the russian word for wow !? ' ||| 3
you might say tykwer has done all that heaven allows , if you wanted to make as anti-kieslowski a pun as possible . ||| 2
many shallower movies these days seem too long , but this one is egregiously short . ||| 2
otto-sallies has a real filmmaker 's eye . ||| 3
lurid and less than lucid work . ||| 1
a portrait of an artist . ||| 2
once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle . ||| 2
with a confrontational stance , todd solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families . ||| 2
many of the effective horror elements are dampened through familiarity , -lrb- yet -rrb- are worthwhile . ||| 2
with its parade of almost perpetually wasted characters ... margarita feels like a hazy high that takes too long to shake . ||| 1
i could just feel the screenwriter at every moment ` tap , tap , tap , tap , tapping away ' on this screenplay . ||| 1
overall , cletis tout is a winning comedy that excites the imagination and tickles the funny bone . ||| 4
you live the mood rather than savour the story . ||| 3
the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled . ||| 3
here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood , and captures them by freeing them from artefact , and by showing them heartbreakingly drably . ||| 2
some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . ||| 3
it 's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . ||| 3
while american adobo has its heart -lrb- and its palate -rrb- in the right place , its brain is a little scattered -- ditsy , even . ||| 1
unfolds with such a wallop of you-are-there immediacy that when the bullets start to fly , your first instinct is to duck . ||| 4
and it 's a lousy one at that . ||| 0
it 's not too fast and not too slow . ||| 3
it 's an entertaining movie , and the effects , boosted to the size of a downtown hotel , will all but take you to outer space . ||| 3
it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental , and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients . ||| 3
compellingly watchable . ||| 4
despite some comic sparks , welcome to collinwood never catches fire . ||| 1
he may have meant the internet short saving ryan 's privates . ||| 2
though jackson does n't always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape , it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees . ||| 3
not only does spider-man deliver , but i suspect it might deliver again and again . ||| 4
it 's worth taking the kids to . ||| 4
the movie plays up the cartoon 's more obvious strength of snazziness while neglecting its less conspicuous writing strength . ||| 2
without shakespeare 's eloquent language , the update is dreary and sluggish . ||| 0
dense , exhilarating documentary . ||| 3
... feels as if -lrb- there 's -rrb- a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . ||| 0
poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures . ||| 3
a perfectly acceptable , perfectly bland , competently acted but by no means scary horror movie . ||| 2
methodical , measured , and gently tedious in its comedy , secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie -- which may be why it 's so successful at lodging itself in the brain . ||| 4
this is amusing for about three minutes . ||| 2
though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism , heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors . ||| 3
superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen . ||| 4
a metaphor for a modern-day urban china searching for its identity . ||| 3
it 's a square , sentimental drama that satisfies , as comfort food often can . ||| 3
the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism , and ms. ramsay and her co-writer , liana dognini , have dramatized the alan warner novel , which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting . ||| 3
admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature , r xmas , marks a modest if encouraging return to form . ||| 4
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . ' ||| 1
an ugly-duckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental . ||| 0
becomes a bit of a mishmash : a tearjerker that does n't and a thriller that wo n't . ||| 0
at its worst , the movie is pretty diverting ; the pity is that it rarely achieves its best . ||| 2
could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format ? ||| 4

what elevates the movie above the run-of-the-mill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish . ||| 4
greengrass -lrb- working from don mullan 's script -rrb- forgoes the larger socio-political picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation . ||| 2
nicholson 's understated performance is wonderful . ||| 4
the filmmakers know how to please the eye , but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story . ||| 3
it 's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson 's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . ||| 1
jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin , inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder . ||| 1
jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can , but all the bouncing back and forth ca n't help but become a bit tedious -- even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting . ||| 2
... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes . ||| 1
over and over again . ||| 1
nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure . ||| 4
this bond film goes off the beaten path , not necessarily for the better . ||| 1
... its solemn pretension prevents us from sharing the awe in which it holds itself . ||| 1
the drama discloses almost nothing . ||| 1
a sham construct based on theory , sleight-of-hand , and ill-wrought hypothesis . ||| 1
isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol 's most intense psychological mysteries . ||| 4
but ` why ? ' ||| 2
like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . ||| 3
perhaps the best sports movie i 've ever seen . ||| 4
this pathetic junk is barely an hour long . ||| 0

playing a role of almost bergmanesque intensity ... bisset is both convincing and radiant . ||| 3
the trappings of i spy are so familiar you might as well be watching a rerun . ||| 1
it treats ana 's journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film . ||| 3

ambitious , unsettling psychodrama that takes full , chilling advantage of its rough-around-the-edges , low-budget constraints . ||| 3
the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girl-meets-girl love story , but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen 's romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring . ||| 3
i could n't recommend this film more . ||| 3
an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . ||| 1
you can taste it , but there 's no fizz . ||| 1
a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it 's nowhere near as exciting as either . ||| 1
a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places , unexamined lives . ||| 3
it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing . ||| 3
why ? ||| 1
and that is where ararat went astray . ||| 1
vincent gallo is right at home in this french shocker playing his usual bad boy weirdo role . ||| 3
clockstoppers is one of those crazy , mixed-up films that does n't know what it wants to be when it grows up . ||| 1
sandra bullock , despite downplaying her good looks , carries a little too much ai n't - she-cute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff . ||| 1
it 's mostly a pleasure to watch . ||| 3
a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be . ||| 2
its spirit of iconoclastic abandon -- however canned -- makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing . ||| 3
a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . ||| 1
i did n't find much fascination in the swinging . ||| 1
this is no `` waterboy ! '' ||| 1
but the nerve-raked acting , the crackle of lines , the impressive stagings of hardware , make for some robust and scary entertainment . ||| 4
a witty , trenchant , wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking . ||| 2
baby-faced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within . ||| 3
the name says it all . ||| 2

it 's been 20 years since 48 hrs . ||| 2
uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be , and among the best films of the year . ||| 4

it 's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . ||| 0
he seems to want both , but succeeds in making neither . ||| 1
funny , though . ||| 2
by turns fanciful , grisly and engagingly quixotic . ||| 3

unofficially , national lampoon 's van wilder is son of animal house . ||| 2
it never is , not fully . ||| 2
it 's just a little too self-satisfied . ||| 2

the film is one of the year 's best . ||| 4
that the chuck norris `` grenade gag '' occurs about 7 times during windtalkers is a good indication of how serious-minded the film is . ||| 2
frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the kahlo movie frida fans have been looking for . ||| 2
one of the year 's most weirdly engaging and unpredictable character pieces . ||| 4
the direction occasionally rises to the level of marginal competence , but for most of the film it is hard to tell who is chasing who or why . ||| 1
the three leads produce adequate performances , but what 's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . ||| 0
`` looking for leonard '' just seems to kinda sit in neutral , hoping for a stiff wind to blow it uphill or something . ||| 1

... one resurrection too many . ||| 1
oh , look at that clever angle ! ||| 3
warmed-over hash . ||| 2
no , i hate it . ||| 0
for a long time the film succeeds with its dark , delicate treatment of these characters and its unerring respect for them . ||| 3
the casting of raymond j. barry as the ` assassin ' greatly enhances the quality of neil burger 's impressive fake documentary . ||| 3
the film is like sitting in a downtown café , overhearing a bunch of typical late-twenty-somethings natter on about nothing , and desperately wishing you could change tables . ||| 0
the filmmakers want nothing else than to show us a good time , and in their cheap , b movie way , they succeed . ||| 3

... a plotline that 's as lumpy as two-day old porridge ... the filmmakers ' paws , sad to say , were all over this `` un-bear-able '' project ! ||| 0
largely , this is a movie that also does it by the numbers . ||| 2
